    "text": "Disadvantages of Telephone Interviews\n\nLittle time is given to respondents for considered answers;\nSurveys are restricted to respondents who have telephone facilities.\nExtensive geographical coverage may get restricted by cost considerations.\nIt is not suitable for intensive surveys where comprehensive answers are required to various questions.\nPossibility of the bias of the interviewer is relatively more.\nQuestions have to be short and to the point; probes are difficult to handle."

    "text": "Disadvantages of Questionnaires\n\nLow rate of return of the duly filled in questionnaires; bias due to no-response is often indeterminate.\nIt can be used only when respondents are educated and cooperating.\nThe control over questionnaire may be lost once it is sent.\nIt is difficult to know whether willing respondents are truly representative.\nThis method is likely to be the slowest of all."
